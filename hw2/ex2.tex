\section*{Exercise 2(i)}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=mycode]
// A convergecast of <ELECT> messages is initiated starting from the
// leaf of the tree.

Every process (p) in the system has the following variables
var replies = 0;
var leader = 0;

upon receiving no message:
	if (neighbors.size() == 1)
		send <ELECT, 1> to neighbor pj

upon receiving <ELECT, COUNT> message from neighbor pj:
	nodes += COUNT;
	if (replies == (num_of_neighbors -1))
		start from pj to send<ELECT, nodes + 1> to remaining neighbors
		terminate

	if (replies == num_of_neighbors)
		return nodes + 1 and terminate
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Message Complexity:} $O(n)$, where $\textbf{n}$ is the
total number of nodes
\paragraph{Time Complexity:} $O(d)$, where ${\textbf{d}}$ is the
longest path of the graph that will send a message

\section*{Exercise 2(ii)}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=mycode]
Code for process p_i
Initially, 

if (p_i == p_r)
	parent_i = nill
	dist_i = 0 
	replies = 0;
	Vector neighbors[];
	check = false;
else
	dist_i = \inf{}

upon receiving no message:
if (pi == pr) and (parenti == null) then
	send <0> to all neighbors;
	parenti = pi

upon receiving <M> from neighbor pj:
	if (m+1 < dist_i) then
		dist_i = m+1;
		parent_i = pj;
		if (dist_i == k)
			send <NBR, (num_of_neighbors - 1) > to parent_i
		send <dist_i> to all neighbors except pj

upon receiving <NBR, num> from neighbor pj:
	if (parent i != id)
		send <NBR, num> to parent_i
	else
		neighbors[replies] = num_nodes
		replies++;
		if (replies == num_of_neighbors)
			return true if all elements in the neighbors vector are
			the same
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Message Complextity:} $O(m*n)$, where m is the number of
messages send to the all nodes (n).

\paragraph{Time Complextity:} $O(d)$, where $\textbf{d}$ is the
diameter of the graph, the length of the longest of the shortest path
between any two vertices.

	parent_i = nill
	replies = 0;
	phase = 0;
else
	dist_i = \inf{}

upon receiving no message:
	if (pi == pr) and (parent_i == null) then
		send <SEARCH> to all neighbors;
		parent_i = pi

upon receiving <SEARCH> from neighbor pj:
	if (parent_i == NULL)
		parent_i = pj;
		send <ACK, 1> to pj
	else if (parent_i == pj)
			send <SEARCH> to all children except pj
	else if 
			send <NACK> to pj

upon receiving <ACK, num> from neighbor pj:
	replies ++
	count += num

	if pj not in the childrens set:
		add pj to childrens

	if (parent_i == pi)
		if (replies == num_of_neighbors)
			replies = 0;
			phase ++
			map = <phase, count>
			count = 0;
			send <SEARCH> to all children
	else
